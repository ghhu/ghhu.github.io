<h2>Research interests, <a href="./publication.html"><font size=3>Publication list</font></a></h2>
<p>I am interested in the adaptive numerical methods for partial
  differential equations, the related numerical analysis, as well as
  their applications in computational physics. In particular, my
  research focuses on the following two problems,
  <ul>
    <li>Computational fluid dynamics:
      <p>
	My research in this area focuses on the highly efficient
	numerical methods for simulating the compressible
	flows. More specifically, I am interested in developing a
	high order and adaptive finite volume framework for steady
	Euler equations and their applications in the optimal design
	of the vehicles. I am also interested in developing
	efficient numerical methods for reactive Euler equations,
	which is a model for detonation simulations.
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>Density functional theory:
      <p>
	In this research area, I am interested in using adaptive
	finite element methods to solve the Kohn-Sham and
	time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations, which can be used to
	describe the ground state of a given electronic structure,
	and dynamics of the system with a given external
	potential. In particular, I am interested in the simulating
	the high harmonic generation (HHG) phenomenon, which is of
	fundamental importance in quantum optics, by solving the
	time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation in the time domain.
      </p>	
    </li>
  </ul>
  To support the numerical simulations of the above two works, we
  develop and maintain a C++ library AFVM4CFD for solving Euler
  equations, and a C++ library AFEABIC for solving the density
  functional theory, respectively. Both libraries inherit from a
  general purposed, C++ library of adaptive finite element package,
  named <a href="http://dsec.pku.edu.cn/~rli">AFEPack</a> (Adaptive
  Finite Element Package).
