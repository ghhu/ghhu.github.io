    <p>
      Developing numerical software for both scientific exploration and
      engineering applications is one of my research interests. Currently, I
      mainly concern partial differential equations from a variety of areas such
      as computatoinal fluid dynamics, electronic structure calculations, and
      computational micromagnetics. Due to, e.g., nonlinearity, high
      dimensionality, complexity of the domain and boundary conditions, etc.,
      analytical solutions generally are not available. Hence, a numerical
      solver becomes vital for PDE-based applications, and the efficiency of the
      numerical solver is one of the most important feature desired.
    </p>

    <p><a href="http://dsec.pku.edu.cn/~rli/software.php">AFEPack</a>
      (<b>A</b>daptive <b>F</b>inite <b>E</b>lement <b>Pack</b>age) is a
      general-purposed C++ library for numerical solutions of partial
      differential equations, originally developed by Prof. Ruo Li from Peking
      University and Prof. Wenbin Liu from BNU-HKBU UIC. With over two decades
      development, AFEPack has been successfully applied for scientific and
      engineering computational problems in a variety of areas such as
      computational fluid dynamics, electronic structure calculations,
      computational micromagnetics. In this paper, design philosophy of the
      library, algorithms and data structures used in the discretization of
      governing equations, numerical linear algebra for the discretized system,
      as well as the pre-processing and post-processing of the simulations, will
      be described systematically for the AFEPack. The realization of two main
      features of the library, i.e., adaptive mesh methods and parallel
      computing, will be introduced in detail. The potential of the library for
      large scale scientific/engineering problems would be demonstrated by
      several examples. The future works on developing the library will also be
      discussed.
    </p>

    <p>My research on design, analysis, and coding of numerical algorithms is
    based on AFEPack. Towards different purposes, three specific-purposed
    software have been roughy formed in compressible computational fluid
    dynamics, electronic structure calculations, and computational
    micromagnetics, respectively, which are introduced below.</p>
